# Difficulties
Since the test didn't specified the coding language, i've done it in Python, it's my main language for scripting and algorithm development.
I've completed 2 of the 3 coding questions, and i did the API one which is on a separate folder named github_api.

I don't have any University degree nor experience with coding interviews, i dind't knew anything about the O(n) thing, i did some research tho.
If my knowledge is not suitable for you, thank you in advance, i've had so much fun, learning and coding!

Sincerely,

Pau Cam√≥s Parra :)
